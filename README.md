# Detecting Fake and Real Reviews on Amazon

## Objective  
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can tell whether a review on Amazon is fake or real. With fake reviews becoming more common, this project aims to help consumers by accurately identifying dishonest feedback and improving their decision-making.

## Background  
Fake reviews can greatly influence how people shop and affect sales. As one of the largest online shopping platforms, Amazon deals with a lot of fake reviews, which can mislead customers and hurt the value of honest reviews. Solving this problem is important for keeping customer trust and making sure online reviews remain reliable.

## Impact  
By using this model, Amazon and other e-commerce websites will be able to detect and remove fake reviews more effectively. This will lead to more trustworthy reviews, making customers feel more confident when making purchases. The project plays an important role in ensuring reviews are honest and helpful for buyers.
